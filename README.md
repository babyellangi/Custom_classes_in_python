Initialization: The __init__ method takes length and width as parameters and initializes the instance variables.

Iteration: The __iter__ method is implemented to make the class iterable. It uses the yield keyword to return dictionaries containing the length and width in the specified format when iterated over.

We create an instance of the Rectangle class and iterate over it, printing each dimension.
